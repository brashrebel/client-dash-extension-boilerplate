# Client Dash Extension Boilerplate

If you're looking to integrate with Client Dash than this is your lucky day. We made it easy.

## What does this boilerplate do?

Great question. So this plugin is not intended to be give you any functionality that anyone would consider useful out of the box. Rather it is a template for developers to quickly and easily make something amazing that takes full advantage of and integrates well with [Client Dash](http://w.org/plugins/client-dash/).

Upon activation, this plugin simply displays a sample tab on the Account page and registers several sample settings on the Settings page. It is up to you to make this awesome.

### Who is this for?

* Anyone wanting to get into development and looking for an easy project template
* Me (I use this all the time)
