# Client Dash Extension Boilerplate

If you're looking to integrate with Client Dash than this is your lucky day. We made it easy.

## What does this boilerplate do?

Great question. So this plugin is not intended to give you any functionality that anyone would consider useful out of the box. Rather it is a template for developers to quickly and easily make something amazing that takes full advantage of and integrates well with [Client Dash](http://w.org/plugins/client-dash/).

Upon activation, this plugin simply displays a sample tab on the Account page and registers several sample settings on the Settings page. It is up to you to make this awesome.

### Who is this for?
* Developers who want to get more out of Client Dash
* Developers who would like to integrate their own ideas with Client Dash
* Anyone wanting to get into development and looking for an easy project template
* Me (I use this all the time)

## Installation

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `client-dash-extension-boilerplate` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the Upload utility in WordPress

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Configure settings by going to Settings - >Client Dash
